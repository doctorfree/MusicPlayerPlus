.SS NAME
.PP
blissify - Analyze and make smart playlists from an MPD music database.
.SS SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]blissify\f[R] [SUBCOMMAND] [FLAGS]
.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]blissify\f[R] command can be used to create an MPD playlist of
songs based on computed similarity metrics.
Blissify is a program used to make playlists of songs that sound alike
from your MPD (https://www.musicpd.org/) track library, \[`a] la Spotify
radio.
.PP
Under the hood, it is an MPD (https://www.musicpd.org/) plugin for
bliss (https://crates.io/crates/bliss-audio).
.PP
Blissify needs first to analyze your music library, i.e.
compute and store a series of features from your songs, extracting the
tempo, timbre, loudness, etc.
.PP
After that, it is ready to make playlists: play a song to start from,
run \f[V]blissify playlist 30\f[R], and voil\[`a]!
You have a playlist of 30 songs that sound like your first track.
.PP
Note: you \f[I]need\f[R] to have MPD installed to use blissify.

.SS EXAMPLES
.PP
All the commands below read the \f[V]MPD_HOST\f[R] and
\f[V]MPD_PORT\f[R] environment variables and try to reach MPD using
that.
You might want to change it if MPD is listening to somewhere else than
\f[V]127.0.0.1:6600\f[R] (the default).
.SS Analyze a library
.PP
To analyze your MPD library, use:
.PP
\f[B]blissify update /path/to/mpd/music_directory\f[R]
.PP
Note that it may take several minutes (up to some hours, on very large
libraries with more than for instance 20k songs) to complete.
.PP
If something goes wrong during the analysis, and the database enters an
unstable state, you can use:
.PP
\f[B]blissify rescan /path/to/mpd/music_directory\f[R]
.PP
to remove the existing database and rescan all files.
.PP
If you want to see if the analysis has been successful, or simply want
to see the current files in, you can use:
.PP
\f[B]blissify list-db\f[R]
.SS Make a simple playlist
.PP
\f[B]blissify playlist 100\f[R]
.PP
This will add 100 songs similar to the song that is currently playing on
MPD, starting with the closest possible.
.SS Changing the distance metric
.PP
To make a playlist with a distance metric different than the default one
(euclidean distance), which will yield different playlists, run:
.PP
\f[B]blissify playlist --distance <distance_name> 30\f[R]
.PP
\f[V]distance_name\f[R] is currently \f[V]euclidean\f[R] and
\f[V]cosine\f[R].
Don\[aq]t hesitate to experiment with this parameter if the generated
playlists are not to your linking!
.SS Make a \[dq]seeded\[dq] playlist
.PP
Instead of making a playlist with songs that are only similar to the
first song, from the most similar to the least similar (the default),
you can make a playlist that queues the closest song to the first song,
then the closest song the second song, etc, effectively making
\[dq]path\[dq] through the songs.
.PP
To try it out (it can take a bit more time to build the playlist):
.PP
\f[B]blissify playlist --seed-song 30\f[R]
.SS Make an album playlist
.PP
You can also make a playlist of album that sound like the current album
your listening to (more specifically, the album of the current song
you\[aq]re playling, regardless of whether you queued the full album or
not).
.PP
To try it out:
.PP
\f[B]blissify playlist --album-playlist 30\f[R]
.SS Make an interactive playlist
.PP
Interactive playlists start from a song, and let you choose which song
should be played next among the 3 closest songs (the number of songs
displayed is can be set manually):
.PP
\f[B]blissify playlist --interactive-playlist --number-choices 5\f[R]
.PP
By default, it crops the current playlist to just keep the currently
played song.
If you want to just start from the last song and continue from there,
use \f[V]--continue\f[R]:
.PP
\f[B]blissify playlist --interactive-playlist --number-choices 5
--continue\f[R]
