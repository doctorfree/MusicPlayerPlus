## NAME
mpprc - MusicPlayerPlus configuration

## DESCRIPTION

The MusicPlayerPlus configuration file `$HOME/.config/mpprc` contains user configurable settings for the MusicPlayerPlus music library, MPD client, music services, album cover art display, and other settings controlling the system. It acts as a centralized point of configuration for all of the MusicPlayerPlus components. Thus, when a change is made to any of the `mpprc` settings, it should be followed by executing the command `mppinit sync`. The `mppinit sync` command populates the settings in `mpprc` out to the various configuration files used by the MusicPlayerPlus components.

A brief description of each of the settings in `mpprc` follows.

**General settings**

*Music library*

The full path to the location of the music library.

```shell
MUSIC_DIR="~/Music"
```

*MPD client*

The name of the Music Player Daemon client to use.

```shell
MPD_CLIENT="mpcplus"
```

*MusicPlayerPlus initialization*

Whether MusicPlayerPlus has been initialized with `mppinit`. This setting is automatically configured by `mppinit`.

```shell
MPPINIT=
```

*Asciimatics audio*

Whether to play audio during `asciimatics` animations.

```shell
AUDIO=1
```

*Display album cover art*

Whether to display album cover art along with the MPD client and spectrum visualizer.

```shell
COVER_ART=1
```

*Display in a tmux session*

Whether to use `tmux` to display the MPD client, visualizer, and album cover art. This setting may be ignored depending on the mode.

```shell
USE_TMUX=1
```

*Terminal emulator / display mode*

Which terminal emulator or display mode to use.

Can be one of: `console`, `current`, `gnome`, `kitty`, `retro`, `simple`, `tilix`

Where:

- 'console' will force a tmux session
- 'current' will force a tmux session in the current terminal window
- 'gnome' will use the gnome-terminal emulator if installed
- 'kitty' will use the Kitty terminal emulator if installed
- 'retro' will use cool-retro-term if installed
- 'simple' will use the ST terminal emulator if installed
- 'tilix' will use the Tilix terminal emulator if installed

Default fallback if none specified or not available is `kitty`

Uncomment the preferred mode

```shell
#MPP_MODE=console

**Album cover art settings**

*Album cover art position*

Album cover art is positioned within the preferred terminal window with padding values hard coded in the cover art display script. These padding values are customized for each of the supported terminal emulators. The default padding values should suffice but they can be overriden here. To override the padding values, set `OVERRIDE_PADDING=1` and set any or all of
the `padding_override_*` values to adjust album cover art placement.

See `~/.config/mpcplus/ueberzug/mpcplus_cover_art.sh` for default padding values.
 
Set to 1 to override default padding, leave unset to use custom defaults

```shell
OVERRIDE_PADDING=
# Uncomment any or all and set preferred padding value(s)
# padding_override_top=3
# padding_override_bottom=1
# padding_override_right=0
# padding_override_left=1
```

*Album cover art font size*

The font size in pixels is set to 22x45 for album cover art display. To override this, set OVERRIDE_FONT_SIZE=1 and adjust the font width and/or font height in pixels to match your system.

```shell
OVERRIDE_FONT_SIZE=
# Uncomment either or both and set font width and/or font height value(s)
# font_override_width=22
# font_override_height=45
```
